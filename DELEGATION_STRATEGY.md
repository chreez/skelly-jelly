## Coordination Mechanisms

### **Daily Synchronization**
- **Time:** 30 minutes at start of each wave
- **Participants:** All agents
- **Agenda:** Progress updates, blockers, handoff coordination
- **Output:** Updated task assignments and dependency resolution

### **Cross-Agent Handoffs**
#### Integration → ML
- **Trigger:** Event Bus operational with test data flowing
- **Deliverables:** Event schema validation, sample data sets
- **Timeline:** End of Week 1

#### ML → UX  
- **Trigger:** State detection accuracy >70% on test data
- **Deliverables:** State classification API, confidence scores
- **Timeline:** End of Week 3

#### All → QA
- **Trigger:** Each story completion
- **Deliverables:** Feature implementation, test data, acceptance criteria
- **Timeline:** Continuous throughout waves

### **Shared Context Management**
- **Event Schemas:** Centralized in `/contracts/` (maintained by Integration)
- **Performance Baselines:** Updated by Performance Agent in `/benchmarks/`
- **Security Requirements:** Documented by Security Agent in ADRs
- **Quality Gates:** Maintained by QA Agent in test specifications

## Communication Protocols

### **Status Updates**
```yaml
Format: 
  - Agent: [Agent Name]
  - Story: [Story ID]
  - Progress: [Percentage Complete]
  - Blockers: [List of dependencies/issues]
  - Next: [Next 24h planned work]
  - Handoffs: [Upcoming deliverables to other agents]
```

### **Handoff Documentation**
```yaml
Handoff:
  - From: [Source Agent]
  - To: [Target Agent]  
  - Deliverable: [What is being delivered]
  - Acceptance Criteria: [How to validate]
  - Context: [Background information needed]

```

## Risk Management

### **Agent Overload Prevention**
- **Max Concurrent Stories:** 2 per agent
- **Overflow Strategy:** QA and Performance agents provide backup

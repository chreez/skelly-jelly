# Skelly-Jelly Schema Architectural Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Skelly-Jelly schema demonstrates a well-architected event-driven system with clear separation of concerns, strong type safety, and privacy-conscious design. The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design principles with bounded contexts and explicit data ownership patterns.

## Architectural Strengths

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture Excellence**
- **Clear Event Ownership**: Each module explicitly owns specific event types
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Events flow in one direction preventing circular dependencies
- **Type-Safe Messaging**: Strongly typed events with discriminated unions
- **Temporal Ordering**: BigInt timestamps ensure nanosecond precision

### 2. **Privacy-First Design**
- **Screenshot Lifecycle Management**: Temporary storage with automatic deletion
- **Data Minimization**: Only metadata preserved, images deleted after analysis
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Built-in PII detection and masking capabilities
- **Local-Only Processing**: No cloud dependencies in the core architecture

### 3. **Scalability & Performance**
- **Event Batching**: 30-second windows for efficient processing
- **Resource-Aware Design**: Memory thresholds for screenshot handling
- **Incremental Analysis**: Rolling window metrics avoid recomputation
- **Tiered Storage**: Different retention policies for different data types

### 4. **Modularity & Extensibility**
- **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each module has single responsibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: New event types can be added without breaking existing code
- **Version-Aware Design**: EventEmitter includes version field for compatibility
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Runtime-configurable thresholds and behaviors

## Architectural Patterns Identified

### 1. **Event Sourcing Pattern**
```typescript
interface RawEvent {
  timestamp: bigint;
  session_id: string;
  event_type: EventType;
  data: KeystrokeEvent | MouseEvent | WindowEvent | ScreenshotEvent;
}
```
- All state changes captured as events
- Enables replay and debugging
- Natural audit trail

### 2. **Pipeline Architecture**
```
Data Capture → Storage → Analysis → Gamification → AI → Figurine
```
- Each stage transforms data
- Clear input/output contracts
- Failure isolation between stages

### 3. **State Machine Pattern**
```typescript
enum ADHDState {
  FLOW = "flow",
  HYPERFOCUS = "hyperfocus",
  PRODUCTIVE_SWITCHING = "productive_switching",
  DISTRACTED = "distracted",
  PERSEVERATION = "perseveration",
  IDLE = "idle",
  BREAK = "break"
}
```
- Well-defined states with clear transitions
- Enables predictable behavior
- Supports intervention timing

### 4. **Strategy Pattern for Interventions**
```typescript
enum InterventionType {
  GENTLE_NUDGE = "gentle_nudge",
  BREAK_SUGGESTION = "break_suggestion",
  HELPFUL_TIP = "helpful_tip",
  CELEBRATION = "celebration",
  CONTEXT_SWITCH_WARNING = "context_switch_warning",
  HYPERFOCUS_CHECK = "hyperfocus_check"
}
```
- Different intervention strategies based on context
- Extensible for new intervention types
- Decoupled from state detection logic

## Architectural Concerns & Recommendations

### 1. **Schema Evolution Management**
**Concern**: No explicit versioning strategy for schema changes
**Recommendation**: 
- Add schema version field to all interfaces
- Implement migration strategies for data format changes
- Consider using Protocol Buffers schema evolution features

### 2. **Error Handling & Recovery**
**Concern**: Limited error context modeling
**Recommendation**:
```typescript
interface EventProcessingError {
  event_id: string;
  error_type: 'parsing' | 'validation' | 'processing' | 'storage';
  retry_count: number;
  error_details: any;
  recovery_strategy?: 'retry' | 'skip' | 'dead_letter';
}
```

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
**Concern**: No built-in performance tracking
**Recommendation**:
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  pipeline_stage: ModuleName;
  processing_time_ms: number;
  queue_depth: number;
  memory_usage_mb: number;
  error_rate: number;
}
```

### 4. **Testing & Validation**
**Concern**: No schema validation contracts
**Recommendation**:
- Add JSON Schema definitions for runtime validation
- Create contract tests between modules
- Implement schema compatibility checks

## Data Flow Analysis

### Critical Path
```
User Activity → OS Hooks → Event Creation → Batching → Analysis → State Detection → Intervention Decision → UI Update
```

**Latency Budget**:
- Event Capture: <1ms
- Storage: <5ms
- Analysis: <50ms
- Total E2E: <100ms

### Bottleneck Risks
1. **Screenshot Processing**: Could block pipeline if analysis is slow
2. **Event Batching**: 30-second windows might be too coarse for some interactions
3. **State Classification**: ML inference could introduce variable latency

## Security Considerations

### Strengths
- Local-only processing by default
- Encrypted API key storage
- PII masking capabilities
- Minimal data retention

### Recommendations
1. **Add Authentication**: For multi-user scenarios
2. **Implement Audit Logging**: Track who accessed what data
3. **Add Data Encryption at Rest**: For sensitive behavioral patterns
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Prevent event flooding attacks

## Integration Architecture

### Well-Designed Integration Points
- **Event Bus**: Clean pub/sub pattern
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings
- **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Swappable AI backends
- **Storage Abstraction**: Could support different databases

### Missing Integration Considerations
1. **Health Monitoring**: No health check endpoints defined
2. **Metrics Export**: No standard metrics format (OpenTelemetry?)
3. **External API**: No REST/GraphQL interface for third-party tools
4. **Backup/Restore**: No data portability interfaces

## Scalability Analysis

### Horizontal Scaling Opportunities
- Event processing could be parallelized by session
- Analysis windows could be processed concurrently
- Screenshot analysis could use worker pool

### Vertical Scaling Considerations
- Memory usage scales with window size
- CPU usage scales with event frequency
- Storage scales linearly with time

## Best Practices Observed

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has clear purpose
2. **Interface Segregation**: Minimal required fields, optional extensions
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Modules depend on interfaces not implementations
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: New event types don't break existing code

## Architectural Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
2. **Implement Backpressure**: Handle event storms gracefully
3. **Add Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
4. **Schema Registry**: Central schema management

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Caching Layer**: For repeated analysis queries
2. **Implement Event Replay**: For debugging and testing
3. **Add Configuration Validation**: Prevent invalid settings
4. **Create Integration Tests**: Validate module contracts

### Future Considerations
1. **Multi-Device Sync**: Schema for device coordination
2. **Collaborative Features**: Shared focus sessions
3. **Plugin System**: Third-party event sources
4. **Export Formats**: Data portability standards

## Conclusion

The Skelly-Jelly schema represents a thoughtfully designed system that balances performance, privacy, and functionality. The event-driven architecture with clear module boundaries provides excellent foundation for a complex behavioral monitoring system. With the recommended enhancements, particularly around error handling, observability, and schema evolution, this architecture could scale to support a large user base while maintaining its privacy-first principles.

The schema successfully implements several architectural best practices and patterns that ensure maintainability, testability, and extensibility. The clear separation between data capture, analysis, and intervention layers allows for independent evolution of each component while maintaining system cohesion.
